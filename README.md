German locale for the Vanilla forum software
============================================

This is a german translation for the Vanilla forum software. The original
work had been done by _mniess_ who stopped his contribution in 2011 (afaik).
But I won't take credits for this. Thank you, Matthias.

I have just added several translations which seem to have been introduced in
recent Vanilla releases.

## Installation

To install this locale in your vanilla installation, just extract this
repository into the directory ``locales/german``. Go into the administration
dashboard and activate _de-DE_ and this locale plugin in the _locales_ option.
